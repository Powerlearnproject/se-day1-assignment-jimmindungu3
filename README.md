#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
    Software engineering is the systematic process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications. It's about building reliable, efficient, and user-friendly software solutions.   

    Importance in the technology industry:

    1. Drives innovation: Software engineers create new products and services that shape how we live and work.   
    2. Enables businesses: Software powers operations, from e-commerce platforms to enterprise systems.
    3. Improves efficiency: Automation and software solutions streamline processes and boost productivity.   
    4. Creates economic growth: The software industry generates jobs and contributes significantly to economies.   
    5. Solves problems: Software addresses challenges in various fields, such as healthcare, education, and environment.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

    1. Emergence as a Discipline: The term "software engineering" was coined in the 1960s to address the growing complexity of software development.   
    2. Structured Programming: This paradigm emphasized code readability and maintainability through structured control flow.   
    3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Introduced in the 1980s, OOP revolutionized software development by modeling real-world entities as objects.   
    4. Agile Methodologies: In response to the limitations of traditional waterfall models, agile approaches like Scrum and Kanban prioritized flexibility and adaptability.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    1. Requirements gathering and documentation. Here developers gather and document user requirements.
    2. Design and implementation. Developers come up with an architecture of the application and write the code
    3. Testing. The system is tested to meet user requirements
    4. Meintenance. The softare undergoes routine maintenance to improve on security, catch up with trends and remove bugs that may have been missed

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
    Waterfall
        Sequential: Rigid phases (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment).
        Plan-driven: Detailed upfront planning.   
        Less flexible: Changes are costly and time-consuming.
        Best for: Projects with well-defined requirements and minimal uncertainty.

    Agile
        Iterative: Continuous cycles of planning, development, testing, and feedback.   
        Customer-centric: Focus on delivering value early and often.   
        Flexible: Adapts to changing requirements.   
        Best for: Projects with uncertain requirements or rapidly changing environments.

    Example: 
        Building a website vs. developing a web app. A website project has clear, unchanging requirements and benefits from a structured Waterfall approach. A web app, on the other hand, often involves uncertain features and user preferences, making Agile more suitable.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
    Software Developer: Builds software by writing code, solving problems, and testing.
    QA Engineer: Ensures software quality by testing, finding bugs, and verifying functionality.
    Project Manager: Oversees the entire development process, manages resources, and ensures project success.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
    Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
        IDEs are software applications that provide a comprehensive set of tools for software development. They boost efficiency by combining code editing, building, testing, and debugging into one interface.   

        Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse.   

    Version Control Systems (VCS)
        VCS track and manage changes to code over time. They enable collaboration, prevent data loss, and allow for code restoration.   

        Examples: Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    1. Changing Requirements: Agile methodologies, clear communication, and iterative development can help.   
    2. Tight Deadlines: Prioritization, time management, and efficient development practices are essential.
    3. Technical Debt: Regular code refactoring, proper documentation, and test coverage can mitigate risks.
    4. Team Collaboration: Effective communication, shared goals, and collaboration tools can improve teamwork.
    5. Security Threats: Regular security audits, code reviews, and staying updated on security best practices are crucial.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
    1. Unit Testing: Tests individual components or units of code to ensure they function correctly. It's the foundation for building reliable software.
    2. Integration Testing: Combines individual units to verify how they interact and work together as a group. It helps identify interface issues.
    3. System Testing: Evaluates the complete system to ensure it meets specified requirements. It covers functionality, performance, security, and usability.
    4. Acceptance Testing: Determines if the software meets the needs of the end-users. It's the final quality gate before release.

These testing levels work together to improve software quality, reduce defects, and increase user satisfaction.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
    Prompt engineering is the art of crafting effective prompts to guide AI models in generating desired outputs. It's like giving clear instructions to an AI assistant.   
    Importance: Accurate and relevant outputs. Well-crafted prompts improve the quality of AI-generated content.   


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
    Vague prompt: "Write something about dogs."

    Improved prompt: "Write a 200-word informative paragraph about the intelligence of border collies."

    The improved prompt is more effective because it specifies the desired content (informative paragraph), the topic (border collies), and the word count, providing clear guidelines for the AI model to generate relevant and focused output.
